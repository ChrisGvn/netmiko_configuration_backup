### Netmiko script for backing up router &amp; switch configurations
<p>Not much to write in this one. Feed the script with the required info and it saves the device's configuration as a .txt file. <br> I've done some tests on my GNS3 lab, where I use Cisco routers and Arista switches. It works fine with all the images I'm using.</p>
<p>In the upcoming future, I will attempt to implement some input validation functions, just so the script accepts as less jibberish as it is possible.</p>
